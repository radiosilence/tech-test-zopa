# ReactJS Coding Challenge - Zopa
 
Congratulations! You're here because you've made it through to the next step of your Zopa interview.
 
We'd like to ask you to complete this coding challenge, so you can showcase your creative problem-solving and technical ability.
 
We hope you'll enjoy it. It should take around **4 hours**, give or take. We're happy to look at partial solutions too.
 
We're on the lookout for best practices and evidence that you understand the technology. The one thing we insist on is that you use React to complete this challenge â€“ but you're free to use any other libraries or tools on top.
 
## The background
 
Your challenge is to create a web application that helps you send money to friends.
 
On the left side of the screen, you have a form to enter your friend's details. On the right side, you have your account details.
 
You will fill in the form with your friend's details, name, email and amount you'd like to send. Each field of the form has inline validation displaying error messages when one of the field is not valid. Clicking the "Send" button will create a transaction if the fields are valid and there is enough money available in the account.
 
The account shows how much money you've sent so far and how much is available. You can set the initial amount to whichever value you'd like. The difference is represented on a circular graphic which updates every time you send money to someone. Under it, you can see the details of your past transactions.
 
## Your task
 
- Build the screen so it follows the guidelines from the supplied design screenshot.
- Implement the logic as described above.
- Provide unit tests. We recommend to use [jest](https://codesandbox.io/docs/tests)
 
Bonus points (optional, only if you have time to spare):
- The application is designed for desktop. Use your creativity to make the design responsive, so it looks great on mobile devices as well.
- To make this challenge more realistic, you can submit the form to [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), or any other suitable service, and add the transaction when you get a valid response.
 
## How to get started
 
-Fork this project or start a new project on your local machine.
-If you have completed this challenge on your local machine, you will have to upload it to codesandbox and make sure it is running. See [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/cli) for the instructions.
 
## How to submit your web application
 
When you're happy with the result, send the link to your forked project to your recruiter. Please don't publish it to a publicly accessible repository.
 
## Suggested libraries and tools
 
- [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux): Keep the entire state of your app in a single place.
- [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components): Use tagged template literals to style your components.
- [typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)/[flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow): Strong types make your code more reliable when you work in larger teams.
- [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Powerful tool to setup a quick backend.
